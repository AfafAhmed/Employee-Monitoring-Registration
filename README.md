# Project Discription
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
 1. created a tool that do the task of employee registration using therir facial features, And detects the employee with their face and display their name on the GUI.
 2. It is a easily maintainable tool, and this is paar better peroforming project then other face recognization projects in industry. 
 3. Created as a Proof of Concept(POC) and aim to register and detect the face of emplyoees in the organization.
 4. Deployed this POC for Internship(at Ineuro.ai) (as Freasher)
  

# Tools and Technologies Used
  1. Programming language: Python 3.6
  2. Deep Learning Framework: MXNET, Keras
  3. Desktop App: Tkinter
  4. Image Processing: OpenCV
  5. Face Detection Algorithm: MTCNN
  6. Face Recognition Algorithm: Arcface
  
# Deployment
  The entire solution was deployed as an on prem solution with the required infrastructure and setup done.
